T2 System Development Environment
  ... more than a Linux distribution.

T2 SDE is not just a regular Linux distribution - it is a flexible Open Source System Development Environment or Distribution Build Kit (others might even name it Meta Distribution). T2 allows the creation of custom distributions with state of the art technology, up-to-date packages and integrated support for cross compilation. Currently the Linux kernel is usually used, but we also consider to port T2 to support compiling home-brew open source package add-ons on macOS, other BSDs, classic Unix systems (Irix, ...) or support bootstrapping alternative micro kernel systems (like a L4 variant or Fuchsia). Similarly building Haiku, Android, Minix, Hurd, Open (or Pure) Darwin, Haiku and OpenBSD.
